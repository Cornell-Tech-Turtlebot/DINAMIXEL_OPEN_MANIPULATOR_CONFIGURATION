# 1.0 Introduction

This repository contains the necessary files to adjust the baud rates and motor IDs for the Open Manipulator Dynamixel servos. The 2020 Cornell Tech robotics internship team adjusted these parameters and labeled the servos such that configuration is not necessary.

However, these files are included for future reference. 

# Using the Repo

To program the servos, the [Arduino IDE] (https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/arduino_ide/) needs to be installed, along with the OpenCR Library for Arduino.

Next, [clone this repo](https://github.com/Cornell-Tech-Turtlebot/DINAMIXEL_OPEN_MANIPULATOR_CONFIGURATION) to a local directory. (i.e.: using command line: git clone https://github.com/Cornell-Tech-Turtlebot/DINAMIXEL_OPEN_MANIPULATOR_CONFIGURATION.git)
